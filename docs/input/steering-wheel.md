# Steering-wheel roller - zoom & route-info toggle

The left MFW roller has two axes: **rotation** and **press**. Rotation zooms the stock native map,
except while a MOST cluster's MAP view shows the phone's map, which it then zooms instead; the
press is repurposed.

## 📋 Context

> MFW roller -> **rotation** = native-map zoom, or the phone's cluster map on the MOST MAP view -
> **press** = cluster route-info toggle ->
> [bap-fctids](../rgd/bap-fctids.md) FctID 19 -> [rgd-activation](../rgd/rgd-activation.md).

## 🔄 Rotation (zoom)

The roller sends rotation as Navigation-BAP `MapScale.steps` (positive zooms out).
`ScreenCombiBAPListener.setMapScale` hands them to `ClusterVideo.zoom` first, which takes them
only while the phone's cluster stream is live and the MAP view composes it
([most-map-view](../cluster/most-map-view.md)): it sends them to the hook as `CMD_ALT_ZOOM`
(at most 8 a report), and the hook asks the phone for one `changeMapZoomLevel` per step on the
cluster display (the MU1329 reference's command). Stock then gets 0 steps: its map keeps its
scale and it still answers the request (`updateMapScale`). Otherwise - an FPK cluster, the
arrows view alone, no live stream, no hook connection - the steps fall through to stock, which
zooms the native cluster map exactly as stock does. (The listener also observes FctID 44
visibility and FctID 54 stage for the KDK layers - see [kdk-geometry](../cluster/kdk-geometry.md).)

## ⚙️ Press (OK) -> route-info toggle

The raw MFW roller press (DSI key 40, `KEY_MFW_ROLLER_LEFT`) and the centre-console DDS (key 16,
`KEY_DDS`) both collapse to the same `DDS_SELECT` in the stock keyboard stack. `SteeringWheelInputModule`
observes the raw `ATTR_KEY2` stream and marks only key 40, so `CarplayDSILifecycleController.updateKey`
can **suppress that one copy** of `DDS_SELECT` before it reaches iOS (via `consumeCollapsedSelect`) -
the centre knob still selects in the CarPlay Main UI.

Gated to the confirmed VC map tab, the press then calls `ScreenModule.onSteeringWheelOkPressed()` ->
`RouteGuidance` toggles the cluster route-info line between the **next turn-to street** (phase 0) and
the **trip summary** (ETA / arrival clock + remaining, phase 1). Phase 1 falls back to phase 0 by
itself 20 s after it was published. Text layout: [vc-route-text](../rgd/vc-route-text.md) (FctID 19).
