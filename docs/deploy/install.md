# Install, verify and uninstall

*The build scripts only produce loose binaries. A release is staged by hand and installed either with
the M.I.B. custom script (recommended) or by hand in a root shell on the unit. Both do exactly the same thing: copy eight
files, replace one SI child and register five iAP2 message IDs. Nothing is started, stopped or
rebooted for you.*

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Back up anything you change by hand. The M.I.B. script keeps a `.carplay-stock` copy of every
> config it edits, but a manual install is only as reversible as your own backups.

## 📦 What a release contains

This branch replaces **no stock binary** and edits **no firewall profile**: the cluster keeps the
head unit's own map, so there is no CarPlay video stream and no extra RTSP port to open. A release is
eight files plus two in-place config edits.

| File | Source in the repo | On-unit path | Mode |
|---|---|---|---|
| `libcarplay_hook.so` | `build/` (`build_hook.sh`) | `/mnt/app/root/hooks/` | 755 |
| `maneuver_render` | `build/` (`build_renderers.sh`) | `/mnt/app/root/hooks/` | 755 |
| `flag_atlas.rgba` | `maneuver_render/resources/` | `/mnt/app/root/hooks/` (read from there, `maneuver_render/main.c:45`) | 644 |
| `carplay_startup.sh`, `carplay_monitor.sh`, `carplay_processes.sh`, `carplay_cleanup.sh` | `deploy/smartphone_integrator/` | `/mnt/app/root/hooks/` | 755 |
| `carplay_hook.jar` | `build/` (`build_java.sh`) | `/mnt/app/eso/hmi/lsd/jars/` | 644 |
| `carplay_child.json` | `deploy/smartphone_integrator/` | not a file on the unit: spliced into `smartphone_integrator.json` as `children.carplay` | - |
| `dio_manager.json` | not staged | `/mnt/system/etc/eso/production/`, five route-guidance IDs added in place | - |

Build the three compiled outputs first (`build_hook.sh`, `build_renderers.sh`, `build_java.sh`); see
[README - Build](../../README.md#-build). Everything else is copied unchanged.

**Compatibility.** Build the patch JAR against the stock library matching the unit's
firmware. The original presentation targets Virtual Cockpit (sysConst 541=2).
This fork also supports the stock arrows view on a map-over-MOST analogue cluster
(541=1), tested on one MU1329 unit; other variants remain untested. The RGI-only
path (541=0) leaves the stock cluster state alone and is untested. See
[MOST validation limits](../cluster/most-cluster.md) and the root README.

This guide covers the upstream `.carplay-stock` installation format. Companion
tooling packages use managed ownership/state and their own rollback action.
Remove an existing installation with its matching installer before switching
formats. Do not apply this uninstaller to a companion-tooling installation.

## 💾 Install with M.I.B. (recommended)

**1. Stage the card.** Copy the contents of `install_MoreIncredibleBash/` to the root of the M.I.B.
SD card, then put the release into `mod/carplay/`. The simplest way: download **all** assets of a
GitHub release and drop them straight into `mod/carplay/` - no folders:

```text
SD1/
  mod/custom.sh
  mod/command.sh
  mod/carplay/carplay_child.json
  mod/carplay/libcarplay_hook.so
  mod/carplay/maneuver_render
  mod/carplay/flag_atlas.rgba
  mod/carplay/carplay_startup.sh
  mod/carplay/carplay_monitor.sh
  mod/carplay/carplay_processes.sh
  mod/carplay/carplay_cleanup.sh
  mod/carplay/carplay_hook.jar
```

`custom.sh` knows where each of these names goes (`/mnt/app/root/hooks/`, the jar to
`/mnt/app/eso/hmi/lsd/jars/`) and ignores any other file in the folder. A self-built release from
the repo can use the same flat layout (`build/` outputs, `maneuver_render/resources/flag_atlas.rgba`,
the five files from `deploy/smartphone_integrator/`), or a tree with each file at its on-unit path
under `root/`:

```text
SD1/
  mod/custom.sh
  mod/command.sh
  mod/carplay/carplay_child.json                   from deploy/smartphone_integrator/
  mod/carplay/root/mnt/app/root/hooks/libcarplay_hook.so
  mod/carplay/root/mnt/app/root/hooks/maneuver_render
  mod/carplay/root/mnt/app/root/hooks/flag_atlas.rgba
  mod/carplay/root/mnt/app/root/hooks/carplay_startup.sh
  mod/carplay/root/mnt/app/root/hooks/carplay_monitor.sh
  mod/carplay/root/mnt/app/root/hooks/carplay_processes.sh
  mod/carplay/root/mnt/app/root/hooks/carplay_cleanup.sh
  mod/carplay/root/mnt/app/eso/hmi/lsd/jars/carplay_hook.jar
```

`.gitignore` keeps the staged payload out of git, so the card can be staged in place inside the repo.
Both layouts can be mixed; the flat files are installed first.

**Checks before anything is copied** (`list_payload` in `custom.sh`). The flat release is all or
nothing: `custom.sh` knows the eight names and checks each one on the card by name, so a partly
copied release stops with `FAILED release incomplete, missing in …: <names>` (a new
`carplay_startup.sh` must never run without `carplay_monitor.sh`). The card is never walked for the
flat files. The `root/` tree does need `find`, and QNX fs-dos makes it fail with
`./dir/..: Filename too long` on some FAT cards although its list is complete, so exactly that error
is tolerated and any other `find` error fails the install.

**2. Run it.** Disconnect CarPlay, then **GEM -> M.I.B. -> Advanced Settings** and pick the script
entry your M.I.B. shows:

| M.I.B. | Entry | Runs |
|---|---|---|
| `main` since `e531867` (2024-07-05) | **Run Custom Script** | `/mod/custom.sh` |
| release zips up to V3.7.1 | **Run individual script** | `/mod/command.sh`, which forwards to `custom.sh` |

The card is FAT and cannot hold a symlink, so `command.sh` is a two-line forwarder; when the M.I.B.
launcher sources it while installing M.I.B. itself, it does nothing. With `custom.sh` alone a release
M.I.B. prints "Nothing to do!". If the script is started on the RCC it hands itself to the MMX.
`custom.sh`:

1. remounts `/mnt/app` and `/mnt/system` read-write;
2. copies each flat release file to its fixed path and every file under `root/` to the same path
   under `/`, each through `<file>.carplay-new.<pid>`
   and an atomic `mv`, and sets its mode (755 for `.so`, `maneuver_render`, `*.sh`; 644 otherwise);
3. deletes M.I.B.'s `NavActiveIgnore.jar` / `navignore_*.jar` if present (see [Traps](#-traps));
4. replaces the `"carplay"` child of `smartphone_integrator.json` with `carplay_child.json`, keeping
   the trailing comma, and refuses to write if the child count would change;
5. registers the route-guidance IDs in `dio_manager.json` (see
   [Route-guidance message IDs](#-route-guidance-message-ids));
6. runs `sync` and prints `DONE (install). Reboot the HU to load.`

It stops no processes and does not reboot. Re-running it is safe: the stock backups are taken once
and never overwritten by a patched file.

**3. Read the output.** Look for `SI json patched` and `dio_manager.json route-guidance IDs registered`
(or `already registered`). A `WARN` line means that file had an unexpected layout and was left as-is:

| Output | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `no payload in …/carplay (release files or root/ tree)` | neither release files nor `root/` found | stage the card again |
| `FAILED release incomplete, missing in …: <names>` | only part of the release reached `mod/carplay/` | copy all release assets again |
| `FAILED listing payload` | `find` over `root/` failed with an unexpected error | check the card, or use the flat release layout |
| `WARN no carplay_child.json resource` | JSON patch skipped, the hook will never load | put `carplay_child.json` in `mod/carplay/` and re-run |
| `WARN unsupported carplay layout` / `expected one carplay child` | SI json not in the stock shape | edit it by hand ([manual step 3](#3-edit-two-config-files)) |
| `WARN dio_manager.json: …; left as-is` | the ID lists were not found exactly once | add the IDs by hand before rebooting |

**4. Flush and reboot** - see [Reboot and verify](#-reboot-and-verify).

## 🔧 Manual install (without M.I.B.)

The same install by hand. You need a **root shell on the unit, over SSH or Telnet**, whichever your
unit has enabled. How you get one and the address to connect to depend on your unit; this guide does
not assume either. Disconnect CarPlay first. Put the release files somewhere on the unit (an SD card
or USB stick works) and `cd` there.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram

  accDescr: Remount both partitions writable, copy the eight files and set their modes, edit the SI child and dio_manager.json as text, then sync, wait and reboot manually.

  you->>you: sync, wait a few seconds
  you->>you: reboot (normal, not forced)
```

### 1. Make the partitions writable

```bash
mount -uw /mnt/app
mount -uw /mnt/system
mkdir -p /mnt/app/root/hooks
```

### 2. Copy the files

```bash
cp libcarplay_hook.so maneuver_render flag_atlas.rgba /mnt/app/root/hooks/
cp carplay_startup.sh carplay_monitor.sh carplay_processes.sh carplay_cleanup.sh /mnt/app/root/hooks/
chmod 755 /mnt/app/root/hooks/libcarplay_hook.so /mnt/app/root/hooks/maneuver_render /mnt/app/root/hooks/carplay_*.sh
chmod 644 /mnt/app/root/hooks/flag_atlas.rgba
cp carplay_hook.jar /mnt/app/eso/hmi/lsd/jars/
chmod 644 /mnt/app/eso/hmi/lsd/jars/carplay_hook.jar
```

To replace a file that is already running (an update over a previous install), copy it to
`<name>.new` in the same folder and `mv` it onto the real name: a `mv` inside one partition is a
rename, so the running process keeps the copy it already opened and nothing ever sees a half-written
file. Do **not** overwrite the stock `/etc/scripts/carplay_cleanup.sh`: ours lives in
`/mnt/app/root/hooks/` and calls the stock one for Audi's mdnsd/PPS teardown.

### 3. Edit two config files

Edit each on the unit, or copy it off, edit it and copy it back. Keep a stock copy first:

```bash
F=/mnt/system/etc/eso/production
cp -p $F/smartphone_integrator.json $F/smartphone_integrator.json.carplay-stock
cp -p $F/dio_manager.json $F/dio_manager.json.carplay-stock
```

The `.carplay-stock` names are the ones the M.I.B. uninstaller restores, so a manual install can
still be removed with it.

**`smartphone_integrator.json`**: replace the whole `"carplay": { … }` block under `children` with the
contents of `deploy/smartphone_integrator/carplay_child.json`, and keep the comma after it. The stock
block runs `dio_manager` directly; ours runs `carplay_startup.sh`, which scopes `LD_PRELOAD` to its own
`dio_manager` (there is **no** `LD_PRELOAD` in `envs`):

```json
"carplay": {
  "exec": "carplay_startup.sh",
  "path": "/mnt/app/root/hooks",
  "params": "",
  "envs": [
    "LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/app/root/lib-target:/eso/lib:/mnt/app/usr/lib:/mnt/app/armle/lib:/mnt/app/armle/lib/dll:/mnt/app/armle/usr/lib",
    "IPL_CONFIG_DIR_DIO_MANAGER=/etc/eso/production"
  ],
  "startupTimeout": 10000,
  "stopTimeout": 8000,
  "watchdogTimeout": 60000,
  "disableWatchdog": false,
  "maxSetupRetries": 2,
  "maxRuntimeRetries": 2,
  "decoderUse": false,
  "selfTermination": true,
  "cleanupScript": "/mnt/app/root/hooks/carplay_cleanup.sh",
  "retriesBeforeDowntime": 3,
  "downtime": 30000,
  "restartDelay": 3000,
  "portResetTime": 250
},
```

**`dio_manager.json`**: append the five route-guidance IDs at the end of the two lists. The stock lists
are the same on every unit, so the two lines change like this:

```json
before:
"MessagesSentByAccessory":["0x5000", "0x5002", "0xAE00", "0xAE02", "0xAE03", "0x4154", "0x4156", "0x4157", "0x4159", "0xFFFB", "0x4C00", "0x4C02", "0x4C03", "0x4C05"],
"MessagesReceivedFromDevice":["0x4E09", "0x4E0A", "0x4E0C", "0x5001", "0xAE01", "0x4155", "0x4158", "0xFFFA", "0xFFFC", "0x4C01", "0x4C04"],

after:
"MessagesSentByAccessory":["0x5000", "0x5002", "0xAE00", "0xAE02", "0xAE03", "0x4154", "0x4156", "0x4157", "0x4159", "0xFFFB", "0x4C00", "0x4C02", "0x4C03", "0x4C05", "0x5200", "0x5203"],
"MessagesReceivedFromDevice":["0x4E09", "0x4E0A", "0x4E0C", "0x5001", "0xAE01", "0x4155", "0x4158", "0xFFFA", "0xFFFC", "0x4C01", "0x4C04", "0x5201", "0x5202", "0x5204"],
```

The file carries `##` comment lines, so edit it as text and never run it through a JSON tool.

### 4. Flush and reboot

```bash
sync
```

Then continue with [Reboot and verify](#-reboot-and-verify).

## 🧭 Route-guidance message IDs

Route guidance needs **two** things; the install provides the second:

1. **The hook's Identify patch** (automatic, at runtime). It adds the route-guidance component
   `0x001E` to the outgoing iAP2 Identify so iOS offers route guidance at all (see
   [iap2-interception](../hook/iap2-interception.md)). It does not touch any message-ID list.
2. **The message-ID registration** in `dio_manager.json`. The Cinemo iAP2 SDK inside `dio_manager`
   only passes listed messages; without the IDs iOS sends route guidance and the SDK drops it before
   the hook sees it, and iOS never sends lane guidance (`0x5204`) unless it is in the received list.

| List | IDs to add | Messages |
|---|---|---|
| `MessagesSentByAccessory` | `0x5200`, `0x5203` | StartRouteGuidanceUpdates, StopRouteGuidanceUpdates |
| `MessagesReceivedFromDevice` | `0x5201`, `0x5202`, `0x5204` | RouteGuidanceUpdate, RouteGuidanceManeuverUpdate, LaneGuidanceInformation |

**In the installer**, `patch_dio()` does this in plain ksh: it reads the file line by line, appends each
missing ID before the list's closing `]`, leaves `##` lines alone, refuses to write unless it found
exactly one of each list and all five IDs are present afterwards, backs up the stock file once as
`dio_manager.json.carplay-stock` and swaps the result in with an atomic rename. Re-running it is a
no-op. `scripts/test_install_dio.sh` (part of `scripts/run_tests.sh`) checks all of that under ksh,
dash and sh.

<details>
<summary>From the host over SSH, when the unit only needs this one step</summary>

Run in a `#!/bin/bash` script (zsh does not word-split), with `HU` set to the unit's SSH target:

```bash
F=/mnt/system/etc/eso/production/dio_manager.json

# 1. Make /mnt/system writable and keep a stock backup once.
ssh -n "$HU" "mount -uw /mnt/system; [ -e $F.carplay-stock ] || cp -p $F $F.carplay-stock"

# 2. Pull the file and add the five IDs on the host. Re-running is a no-op.
ssh -n "$HU" "cat $F" > dio_manager.json
python3 - dio_manager.json <<'PY'
import re, sys
path = sys.argv[1]
text = open(path).read()
add = {"MessagesSentByAccessory": ["0x5200", "0x5203"],
       "MessagesReceivedFromDevice": ["0x5201", "0x5202", "0x5204"]}
for key, ids in add.items():
    m = re.search(r'"%s"\s*:\s*\[([^\]]*)\]' % key, text)
    have = [h.upper() for h in re.findall(r'"(0x[0-9A-Fa-f]+)"', m.group(1))]
    new = [i for i in ids if i.upper() not in have]
    if new:
        text = text[:m.end(1)] + "".join(', "%s"' % i for i in new) + text[m.end(1):]
open(path, "w").write(text)
PY

# 3. Push it back atomically (the unit has no scp), then flush to flash.
ssh "$HU" "cat > $F.new" < dio_manager.json
ssh -n "$HU" "chmod 644 $F.new && mv $F.new $F && sync"

# 4. Verify: all five IDs must be printed.
ssh -n "$HU" "grep -o '\"0x520[0-4]\"' $F"
```

To undo only this step: `ssh -n "$HU" "mount -uw /mnt/system; mv $F.carplay-stock $F; sync"`, then
reboot.

</details>

---

## ✅ Reboot and verify

After `sync`, **wait a few seconds**, then reboot normally. A forced reboot (the MMI button combo)
right after copying can leave files truncated or missing, and nothing loads. The install only becomes
active after the reboot: the jar is on j9's boot classpath, and `dio_manager` reads its config only at
start.

On the unit, the three edits must be visible:

```bash
grep carplay_startup.sh /mnt/system/etc/eso/production/smartphone_integrator.json
grep -o '"0x520[0-4]"' /mnt/system/etc/eso/production/dio_manager.json   # all five IDs
ls -l /mnt/app/root/hooks/ /mnt/app/eso/hmi/lsd/jars/carplay_hook.jar
```

Then connect the phone and start a route in Apple Maps: the maneuver panel must appear on the cluster
over the stock map, with the turn arrow on the HUD. Logs: `/tmp/carplay_hook.log`,
`/tmp/carplay_java.log`, `/tmp/maneuver_render.log`, `/tmp/carplay_wrapper.log` (see
[README - Logging](../../README.md#-logging)). If route guidance never appears, check the
`dio_manager.json` grep first: with the IDs missing the SDK drops the messages before the hook, so the
hook logs nothing about them.

## 🗑️ Uninstall

**With M.I.B.:** copy `uninstall_MoreIncredibleBash/` over the card and run the custom script. It
needs no payload tree: it renames every `*.carplay-stock` under `/mnt/app` and `/mnt/system` back to
the original (the SI json and `dio_manager.json`), then deletes the eight owned files and the
renderer's shader cache `/mnt/persist/var/app/luka_carplay_maneuver`. `custom.sh
uninstall` from the install card is a second path while the payload tree is still on it.

**By hand:**

```bash
mount -uw /mnt/app; mount -uw /mnt/system
F=/mnt/system/etc/eso/production
mv $F/smartphone_integrator.json.carplay-stock $F/smartphone_integrator.json
mv $F/dio_manager.json.carplay-stock $F/dio_manager.json
cd /mnt/app/root/hooks && rm -f libcarplay_hook.so maneuver_render flag_atlas.rgba carplay_startup.sh carplay_monitor.sh carplay_processes.sh carplay_cleanup.sh
rm -f /mnt/app/eso/hmi/lsd/jars/carplay_hook.jar
rm -rf /mnt/persist/var/app/luka_carplay_maneuver
sync
```

Then reboot the same careful way.

## 📋 Collect logs

Copy `logging_MoreIncredibleBash/` over the card and run it the same way as the installer. Each run
makes `<card>/carplay_logs/NNN/` (numbered: the unit clock is often wrong; `info.txt` records the clock
and whether verbose was on). It holds the `/tmp` logs (`*.log*`, `carplay_*`, `*.pid`, never the
shared-memory objects that also live in `/tmp`), `sloginfo` of MMX and RCC, `pidin`, mounts, network,
the hook and jar listing, the two configs we patch and cores of `dio_manager`, `maneuver_render` and
`smartphone_integrator`. A read-only card is remounted writable. The run ends by creating
`/tmp/carplay_verbose`, so: run once, reconnect the phone and use CarPlay, run again to save the
verbose session. The marker is in RAM and goes away on reboot; hook and Java log read it at every
CarPlay session start. Nothing is deleted on the unit. Checked by `scripts/test_logging_mib.sh`.

## ⚠️ Traps

**Never restart the Java stack on a live unit.** `carplay_hook.jar` sits on j9's `-Xbootclasspath`, so
it does nothing until the JVM restarts, and killing j9 counts as a critical-process death that
restarts the whole system (about 50 s, screen black). A redeployed `libcarplay_hook.so` is picked up by
the next `dio_manager` generation; the jar only by a reboot.

**A card written from a Mac carries `._name` and `.DS_Store` files.** `custom.sh` skips them, so an
AppleDouble `._carplay_hook.jar` never lands on j9's boot classpath.

**M.I.B.'s NavActiveIgnore jar must not sit next to ours.** "NavActiveIgnore on" copies
`navignore_audi.jar` / `navignore_vw.jar` to `lsd/jars/NavActiveIgnore.jar`. It replaces
`org.dsi.ifc.carplay.AppState` so `getAppStateID()` and `getOwner()` always return 0, and the CarPlay
lifecycle loses which resources CarPlay owns. `custom.sh` deletes it (and hand-copied `navignore_*.jar`)
without a backup; after a manual install, delete it yourself.

**The unit's shell is bare QNX 6.5.** Pushing files over SSH (the host-side snippets above) fails in
predictable ways:

| Trap | Fix |
|---|---|
| no `scp` binary on the unit | `ssh host 'cat > /path/file.new' < local`, then `chmod`, `mv`, `sync` |
| sshd rate-limits repeated password logins | one multiplexed master (`ControlMaster=auto`, short `ControlPath`) reused by every call |
| `ssh` inside `while read` eats the loop's stdin | always `ssh -n` (or `< /dev/null`) in loops |
| zsh does not word-split unquoted `$OPTS` | put deploy snippets in a `#!/bin/bash` script |
| login banner prints on STDOUT even for `ssh host cmd` | for binary read-back print a marker first (`echo __BEGIN__; cat f`) and strip up to it |
| no `sha256sum`, `cksum`, `tar`, `base64` | the only end-to-end check is reading the file back and `cmp` locally |

`/mnt/app` and `/mnt/system` stay read-only until `mount -uw`. `/tmp` is `/dev/shmem` and cannot hold
directories.

Runtime ownership after the reboot (who starts `maneuver_render`, why it outlives `dio_manager`) is in
[supervisor-lifecycle](supervisor-lifecycle.md).
