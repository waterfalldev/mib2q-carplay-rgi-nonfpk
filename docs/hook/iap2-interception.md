# iAP2 interception & the hook framework

`libcarplay_hook.so` is `LD_PRELOAD`ed into `dio_manager` only. Every iAP2 byte from the iPhone first
passes through our `read()` / `recv()` hooks, then continues into the stock Cinemo SDK. We don't
bypass the stock path - we intercept and inject side effects.

    accDescr: Incoming iAP2 bytes are read by the hook, framed, dispatched to registered modules and always forwarded unmodified to Cinemo, while the outgoing Identify is patched to add the RGD component.

    ip["iPhone iAP2 bytes"] --> hk["our read()/recv() hook"]
    hk --> parse["iap2_find_frame<br/>(sync, len, msgid@+4)"]
    parse -->|"registered msgid"| mod["module(s)<br/>RGD - cover-art - screen"]
    parse --> fwd["stock Cinemo SDK<br/>(always forwarded, unmodified path)"]
    hk -. "outgoing Identify" .-> patch["inject RGD component<br/>+ 0x52xx msg-IDs"]
    patch --> fwd
    mod --> bus["side effects -> bus-protocol"]
```

## 📋 Context

> iPhone iAP2 -> **iap2-interception** - parse frames, patch Identify -> modules ->
> [bus-protocol](bus-protocol.md) - to Java. Cover-art tap: [cover-art](cover-art.md).

## ⚙️ Framework

`main.c` is the module table and nothing else: it lists the shipping modules (route-guidance,
cover-art, and `altscreen`, which uses the AirPlay seams rather than iAP2 -
[most-map-view](../cluster/most-map-view.md)) in initialisation order. Nothing auto-registers from an ELF constructor - the framework
registers whatever stands in the table at its first real Cinemo boundary, calls each module's
`on_init`, and tears them down in reverse order. Everything a module wants (Identify, `msgid` filter,
session state, outgoing transport frames, the raw `NmeTransport::Recv` tap) is declared in its own
`hook_module_def_t`, so `hook_framework.c` includes no module header. `hook_framework` keeps a
priority-ordered registry and routes each parsed frame to the modules that asked for its `msgid`.
The shared object exports only the five Cinemo interposers (build-enforced allowlist) - see
[integration-seam](integration-seam.md).

## 🔍 Frame parsing

`iap2_find_frame` scans the transport buffer for the iAP2 frame sync, reads the frame length, the
`msgid` (**BE16 at offset +4**) and the payload (from +6). Route-guidance frames are `0x5200-0x5204`;
the RGD module validates the **whole** message before parsing it and hands a malformed one back to
stock untouched (see [rgd-tlv](../rgd/rgd-tlv.md)).

## 🔧 Identify patcher

On the outgoing iAP2 **Identification** message the hook injects the extra component the stock Cinemo
SDK never advertises (an EAGroup/route-guidance component) plus the `0x52xx` message IDs, so iOS
registers the accessory as route-guidance-capable and starts sending `StartRouteGuidanceUpdates`.
Without this patch iOS never emits any RGD traffic.

## ✅ Checksum

The iAP2 link checksum is applied (NEG, hard-coded) with a one-shot sanity log on the first stock
frame, so an injected/patched frame stays wire-valid.
